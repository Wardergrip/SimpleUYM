# SimpleUYM
Simple Unity YAML Merge is a GUI aimed to make the setup and opening of Unity YAML merge a little easier.

Your configuration of git repository is saved and remembered so that after configuring, opening the merge tool is as easy as clicking a button.

The GUI is based on [this article](https://learn.unity.com/tutorial/working-with-yamlmerge).

## Config help
These are default/example paths to guide you on where to look.

*Note: This also works if Unity is not installed through the HUB and with different Unity versions*
