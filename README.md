# SimpleUYM
Simple Unity YAML Merge is a GUI aimed to make the setup and opening of Unity YAML merge a little easier.

Your configuration of git repository and UnityYAMLMerge are saved and remembered making  opening the merge tool as easy as clicking a button.

The GUI is based on [this article](https://learn.unity.com/tutorial/working-with-yamlmerge).

## How to use
If you have a merge conflict on a Unity prefab or scene file, open SimpleUYM (configure if necessary) and click mergetool. Check after the results first before continuing.

## Config help
These are default/example paths to guide you on where to look.

*Note: This also works if Unity is not installed through the HUB and with different Unity versions*
